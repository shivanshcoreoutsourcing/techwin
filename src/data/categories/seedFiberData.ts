    heading: "What is a Seed Fiber Laser?",
    description:
      "A seed fiber laser acts as the initial light source (or “seed”) for high-power laser systems. It produces a highly stable, narrow-linewidth laser output that is later amplified through fiber amplifiers. These lasers provide a stable foundation for systems where wavelength accuracy, coherence, and low noise are essential. Techwin designs and manufactures high-precision seed fiber lasers used across industrial, scientific, and communication applications.",
